<details>
<summary>How preview environments work</summary>

- **Created** automatically when you push a non-main branch
- **Updated** on every subsequent push to the same branch (TTL extended, code redeployed)
- **Destroyed** when the PR is merged/closed or the branch is deleted
- **TTL cleanup** runs every 4 hours and destroys expired environments

Configuration: [`.idp/config.yml`](.idp/config.yml)
